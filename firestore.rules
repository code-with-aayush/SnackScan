/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SnackScan application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and scan history.
 * Each user can only access their own data, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with profile information at /users/{userId}/profile
 * and scan history entries at /users/{userId}/scanHistory/{scanId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized enumeration of user accounts.
 * - All reads and writes are validated against the authenticated user's UID, ensuring only
 *   the owner can modify their data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userId` is present in both `/users/{userId}/profile` and `/users/{userId}/scanHistory/{scanId}`
 *    documents to avoid needing to perform costly `get()` requests to validate ownership.
