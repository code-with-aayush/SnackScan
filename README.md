<h1><b>🍏 SnackScan – AI-Powered Food Safety Web App</b></h1>
<h3><b>About SnackScan</b></h3>
SnackScan is an AI-driven web application that helps users instantly determine whether a packaged food product is safe based on their personal health conditions. Built using Gemini, Genkit, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase tools, the app blends modern web development with intelligent nutrition analysis.
<br>
Users can scan the back label of any packaged food directly from the web interface. SnackScan uses Gemini’s OCR capabilities to extract ingredients and nutritional data, then runs the information through a custom AI safety evaluation engine. This engine compares the product’s contents with the user’s health profile—such as diabetes, high blood pressure, allergies, or specific dietary preferences—and returns a clear safety verdict:

✔ Safe
⚠ Consume in Moderation
✘ Not Safe
<br>
Every verdict includes a detailed explanation, highlighting risky ingredients or harmful nutrition levels. The system also recommends safer alternatives to support better food choices.
<br>
Designed with a clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS, SnackScan provides a smooth experience across devices. The backend leverages Firebase for secure workflows, while Genkit orchestrates AI pipelines efficiently.

SnackScan aims to make everyday eating smarter, safer, and more personalized through the power of AI.
